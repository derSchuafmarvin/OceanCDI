<h1 align="center">🌊 OceanCDI – Global Energy from Sun, Salt & Sea</h1>

<p align="center">
An open-source megaproject for sustainable electricity, drinking water, and hydrogen production from seawater.<br>
The system uses capacitive deionization (CDI), photovoltaics, electrolysis, and CO₂ synthesis – modular, emission-free, and globally scalable.

## 🧭 Vision

🌐 OceanCDI aims to cover up to **10% of the world's electricity demand** through floating solar modules on the oceans, while also generating **hydrogen as an energy carrier** and providing **drinking water from seawater** – powered solely by sunlight and ocean water.

---

## 🔬 Operating Principle – Simple Overview

1. ☀️ Sunlight activates electrodes in seawater  
2. 🧲 Salt ions attach → electric potential builds up  
3. ⚡ Electricity flows – directly usable or storable  
4. 💧 Desalinated water is produced (→ drinking water)  
5. 🔬 Electrolysis generates hydrogen (H₂)  
6. 🌫️ CO₂ from seawater + H₂ → Methanol (CH₃OH)  
7. 🚢 Methanol is stored, transported, used  

= **Electricity + Hydrogen + Drinking Water + E-Fuels from seawater**
